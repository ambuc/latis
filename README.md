# latis
## (pronounced "_lattice_")
A command-line spreadsheet-style utility. Written in `C++`. Mostly a testing
grounds for writing a parser in the parser-combinator style. (See
`/src/formula/...`.) Might eventually implement a TUI for opening and editing
`.latis` files, performing spreadsheet computations, who knows.
